## Known Limitations

### By Design
1. **Single Organization** - Not multi-tenant (designed for one kitchen)
2. **No Edit After Submit** - Logs are immutable once submitted (audit integrity)
3. **No Mobile App** - Web-only (responsive but not native)
4. **English Only** - No i18n/l10n (future enhancement)

### Technical Debt
1. **No Automated Tests** - Manual testing checklist only
2. **No Real-Time Updates** - Must refresh to see changes (no WebSockets)
3. **Limited Validation** - Client-side only (Ajv validates structure, not business rules)
4. **No Bulk Operations** - Assignments created one at a time
5. **No Export to PDF** - Reports are HTML only (no print optimization)

### Future Enhancements
1. üì± **Mobile App** (React Native)
2. üîî **Push Notifications** (due time reminders)
3. üìä **Advanced Analytics** (trends, predictions)
4. üîÑ **Real-Time Sync** (WebSockets for live updates)
5. üñ®Ô∏è **PDF Export** (reports, logs, assignments)
6. üåê **Multi-Language Support** (i18n)
7. ü§ñ **AI Assistance** (auto-fill common entries)
8. üìà **Trend Detection** (flag unusual patterns)
9. üìÖ **Calendar Integration** (sync with Google/Outlook)
10. üéì **Training Integration** (link logs to training modules)
