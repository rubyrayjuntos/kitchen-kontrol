  Expected: 95%+ production ready
  Full: Complete automated testing & deployment
```

### Easy Next Steps
```
1. Apply validation to remaining routes (copy pattern from auth.js)
2. Write tests for applied validation (copy pattern from auth.test.js)
3. Verify all routes have both validation & tests
4. Setup GitHub Actions (standard template)
5. Deploy to production
```

### Documentation Provided
```
✅ WEEK2_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md has integration examples
✅ All validation schemas documented with usage patterns
✅ Test file examples ready to copy
✅ Troubleshooting guides included
✅ Best practices documented
```
