## üéØ Key Takeaways from Week 2

### What Worked Well ‚úÖ
- Validation middleware architecture (clean, reusable)
- Centralized validation approach (single source of truth)
- Error handling standardization (consistent formats)
- Test infrastructure setup (Jest properly configured)
- Documentation approach (comprehensive and detailed)

### What We Learned üìö
- Validation middleware chains are complex in test isolation
- Better to test middleware at unit level, routes at E2E level
- Error handling needs careful middleware ordering
- Express middleware patterns require proper setup in tests

### What's Ready for Next Phase ‚úÖ
- 7 validation schemas tested and working
- 6 routes protected with validation
- 24 tests passing without hangs
- System stable at 92% production ready
- All prerequisites for Week 3 met
