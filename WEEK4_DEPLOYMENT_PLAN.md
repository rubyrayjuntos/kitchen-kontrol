npx cypress run                       # E2E tests

# Expected: 106/106 tests passing
# Expected: All Cypress specs passing
```

**Linting & Code Quality âœ…**
```bash
# Check for issues
npm run lint                          # If linter configured

# Build verification
npm run build                         # Frontend build
# Check build size is reasonable (~200KB gzipped max)
```

**Security Audit âœ…**
```bash
# Check dependencies
npm audit

# Expected: 0 high/critical vulnerabilities
# If found: npm audit fix (be cautious with upgrades)
```

**Git Status âœ…**
```bash
git status                            # No uncommitted changes
git log --oneline -5                  # Review recent commits
```

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration (Day 1)

**Environment Variables âœ…**
```bash
# Create .env.production (NEVER commit this!)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/kitchendb
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3002
JWT_SECRET=<generate-new-secret>      # Use: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
API_URL=https://yourdomain.com        # Production domain
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Optional monitoring services
SENTRY_DSN=https://...@sentry.io/...
```

**GitHub Secrets âœ…**
```
Add to GitHub repository settings:
- DATABASE_URL
- JWT_SECRET
- SENTRY_DSN (if using)
- DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN (if needed)
```

**Database Preparation âœ…**
```bash
# If using managed database (AWS RDS, etc):
1. Create production database
2. Create database user with appropriate permissions
3. Test connection: psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"

# Run migrations on production database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... npm run migrate:up

# (Optional) Seed initial data if needed
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... npm run seed
```

### Phase 3: Docker Image Verification (Day 2)

**Build & Test Locally**
```bash
# Build backend image
docker build -f Dockerfile.server -t kitchen-kontrol-backend:latest .

# Build frontend image
docker build -f Dockerfile.client -t kitchen-kontrol-frontend:latest .

# Test with test stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
npx cypress run
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down -v
```

**Image Inspection**
```bash
# Check image sizes
docker images | grep kitchen-kontrol

# Expected:
# backend: ~300-400MB (includes node_modules)
# frontend: ~200-300MB (nginx + built React app)

# Scan for vulnerabilities (if available)
docker scan kitchen-kontrol-backend
docker scan kitchen-kontrol-frontend
```

### Phase 4: GitHub Actions Verification (Day 2)

**CI/CD Pipeline Check**
```bash
# View workflows
cat .github/workflows/ci.yml              # Main CI
cat .github/workflows/e2e-docker.yml      # E2E with Docker
cat .github/workflows/cd.yml              # Deployment
cat .github/workflows/code-quality.yml    # Analysis
```

**Trigger Test Workflows**
1. Make a test commit to a feature branch
2. Create a pull request to main
3. Watch GitHub Actions execute automatically
4. Verify all checks pass (green âœ“)
5. Merge to main (or just keep PR for monitoring)

**Verify Workflow Steps**
- [ ] Code checkout successful
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Tests executed
- [ ] Code coverage calculated
- [ ] Build artifacts created
- [ ] All jobs completed successfully

---

## Local Testing & Verification

### Test Suite Execution

**Run All Tests Locally**
```bash
# Component & Integration Tests (JWT-less)
npm test -- --no-coverage

# Expected output:
# PASS  src/components/__tests__/Dashboard.test.js
# PASS  src/components/__tests__/ErrorBoundary.test.js
# PASS  src/components/__tests__/Modal.test.js
# ... (etc)
# Tests: 106 passed, 106 total
# Time: ~2.7 seconds
```

**E2E Tests with Docker**
```bash
# Start test stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# Wait for services
sleep 15

# Run E2E tests
npx cypress run

# Expected: 20+ tests passing
# Captures: Videos and screenshots in cypress/videos/ and cypress/screenshots/

# Cleanup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down -v
```

**Manual Smoke Testing**
```bash
# Start development stack
docker-compose up -d

# Test critical flows manually
1. Frontend loads: http://localhost:3000
2. API is healthy: curl http://localhost:3002/api/health
3. Login works: Use test account
4. Create log entry: Submit form with test data
5. View reports: Check dashboard displays correctly

# Stop stack
docker-compose down
```

### Coverage Report Review

**Generate Coverage Report**
```bash
npm test -- --coverage

# Expected coverage:
# Statements: 50%+ (baseline for MVP)
# Branches: 40%+
# Functions: 50%+
# Lines: 50%+
```

**Review Coverage in Browser**
```bash
# Generate coverage in HTML format
npm test -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='src/**/*.js' --coverageReporters=html

# Open in browser
open coverage/index.html
# or
firefox coverage/index.html
```

**Quick Rollback to Previous Version**
```bash
# Option 1: Using GitHub Actions
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Find last known-good deployment
3. Click "Re-run all jobs"
4. Redeploy previous version

# Option 2: Using Git
git revert <last-commit>
git push origin main
# Render auto-deploys (if connected)

# Option 3: Manual Database Restore (if needed)
# Only if critical data corruption
1. Render/Host â†’ Restore from backup
2. Select pre-deployment backup
3. Restore to specific point in time
```

**Communication**
1. Post message to team: "Rolling back due to [brief issue]"
2. Monitor logs during rollback
3. Verify previous version working
4. Post all-clear message

### Scenario 2: Database Issues (Corruption/Data Loss)

**Database Recovery**
```bash
# 1. Stop application to prevent further writes
Render â†’ Settings â†’ Suspend

# 2. Restore from backup
Database Provider Dashboard â†’ Restore Backup
# Select pre-deployment backup
# Restore to specific point in time

# 3. Verify data integrity
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM logs;"

# 4. Resume application
Render â†’ Settings â†’ Resume
```

**If Production Data Lost**
1. Restore from backup
2. Accept data loss between backup and incident
3. Notify users of any missing data
4. Document incident in postmortem

### Scenario 3: Infrastructure Failure

**If Hosting Fails Completely**

1. **Immediate**: Alert team via Slack/email
2. **Assessment**: Determine cause (database down, network, host down)
3. **Recovery**:
   ```bash
   # Option A: Failover to backup host
   if [ "$PRIMARY_DOWN" = true ]; then
     Redirect traffic to SECONDARY
   fi
   
   # Option B: Rebuild on new host
   1. Get latest code from git main
   2. Create new environment
   3. Restore from database backup
   4. Update DNS/load balancer
   ```

â”‚  â”œâ”€ Data corruption? â†’ Restore from backup + git revert
â”‚  â”œâ”€ Security issue? â†’ git revert + investigate
â”‚  â”œâ”€ High error rate (>1%)? â†’ git revert
â”‚  â””â”€ Performance degraded 50%+? â†’ Check logs first, consider revert
â”‚
â””â”€ NO
   â””â”€ Continue monitoring, don't rollback
```
