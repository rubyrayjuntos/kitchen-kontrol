## 📞 If Something Goes Wrong

### **Build Fails on Render**
1. Check Render build logs
2. Verify `package.json` scripts exist
3. Check environment variables are set
4. Try deploying backend first, then frontend

### **Database Connection Fails**
1. Ensure PostgreSQL service is running
2. Check `DATABASE_URL` is auto-set by Render
3. Verify migrations ran (check logs)

### **Frontend Can't Reach Backend**
1. Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` in frontend settings
2. Set `FRONTEND_URL` in backend for CORS
3. Check both services are deployed
4. Verify URLs match (https, no trailing slash)
