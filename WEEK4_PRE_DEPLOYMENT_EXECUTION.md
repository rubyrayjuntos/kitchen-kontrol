# Week 4: Pre-Production Execution Plan

**Kitchen Kontrol** - October 15-20, 2025  
**Goal:** Complete all preparation for production deployment (Stop before actual deploy)

---

## Quick Overview

This document covers everything needed to get production-ready, but **does NOT include the actual deployment step**. Think of this as "dress rehearsal" - everything is tested and ready to go, but the final curtain hasn't risen.

### What We'll Do
✅ Run all local tests  
✅ Verify GitHub Actions workflows  
✅ Deploy to staging environment  
✅ Test staging thoroughly  
✅ Setup monitoring and alerting  
✅ Create runbooks and documentation  
✅ Final pre-deployment checklist  
✅ **STOP** - Don't deploy to production yet

### What We Won't Do
⏸️ Push application to production  
⏸️ Redirect live users to new app  
⏸️ Make permanent production changes

## Day 4: Monitoring & Alerting Setup

### Morning Tasks (2-3 hours)

#### 1. Setup Error Tracking (Sentry)

**Option A: Sentry.io (Recommended)**

1. Go to https://sentry.io
2. Create account / log in
3. Create new project:
   - Platform: Node.js
   - Name: Kitchen Kontrol
4. Get DSN (looks like: https://xxxxx@sentry.io/1234567)
5. Add to staging environment:
   ```bash
   SENTRY_DSN=https://xxxxx@sentry.io/1234567
   ```
6. Verify integration is working

**Option B: Built-in Logging**

If not using Sentry, ensure Winston logging is configured:

```bash
# Check server.js for Winston setup
grep -n "winston" server.js

# Should see:
# - Logger initialization
# - Error handling middleware
# - Request logging
```

#### 2. Setup Uptime Monitoring

**Using Uptime Robot (Free Tier Available):**

1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com
2. Create account
3. Create new monitor:
   - Type: HTTPS
   - URL: https://kitchen-kontrol-staging.onrender.com/api/health
   - Interval: 5 minutes
   - Alert to: [your-email]
4. Save and verify

**Expected:**
- Monitoring starts immediately
- You receive first check result

#### 3. Setup Email Alerts

**For Render.com:**
1. Dashboard → Settings → Notifications
2. Add email address
3. Enable alerts for:
   - Deployment failed
   - Service suspended
   - Critical health check failed

#### 4. Document Monitoring Setup

Create: `WEEK4_MONITORING_SETUP.md`

```markdown
# Monitoring & Alerting Setup

## Error Tracking
- Service: Sentry.io
- Project: Kitchen Kontrol
- DSN: [configured]
- Alerts to: [team-email@company.com]
- Status: ✅ ACTIVE

## Uptime Monitoring
- Service: Uptime Robot
- URL: https://kitchen-kontrol-staging.onrender.com/api/health
- Interval: 5 minutes
- Alert threshold: 2 failures
- Status: ✅ ACTIVE

## Application Logs
- Service: Render dashboard
- Access: https://render.com/dashbaord
- Log level: info
- Retention: 7 days
- Status: ✅ ACTIVE

## Alerting Contacts
- Primary: [name] [email]
- Backup: [name] [email]
- On-call: [rotation schedule]

## Alert Actions
- Response time: 15 minutes
- Escalation: See WEEK4_RUNBOOK.md
```

### Afternoon Tasks (2-3 hours)

#### 5. Create Production Runbook

Create file: `WEEK4_RUNBOOK.md`

```markdown
# Production Runbook - Kitchen Kontrol

## Quick Links
- Application: https://yourdomain.com
- Dashboard: https://yourdomain.com/admin
- API Health: https://yourdomain.com/api/health
- Logs: [Render/CloudWatch/your-logging-system]
- Monitoring: [Sentry/Uptime Robot]

## Health Check
```bash
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Application Returns 500 Error

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check health endpoint: curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
2. Check logs: Render → Logs
3. Look for error message

**Common causes:**
- Database connection failed
- Missing environment variables
- Unhandled exception in code

**Fix:**
1. Check DATABASE_URL is correct
2. Verify database is up: psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"
3. Restart service: Render → Settings → Restart
4. Check logs for specific error

### Issue: High Error Rate

1. Check recent deployments: git log --oneline -5
2. Review Sentry errors: sentry.io dashboard
3. Check for database issues
4. Consider rollback if recent deployment caused it

### Issue: Slow Response Times

1. Check database query times in logs
2. Verify database is healthy
3. Check server resource usage (CPU, memory)
4. Consider scaling if consistent issue

### Issue: Database Connection Failed

```bash
# Verify connection string
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Test connection
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"

# If fails:
1. Check DATABASE_URL syntax
2. Verify database server is running
3. Check firewall/security groups allow connection
4. Verify database user has permissions
```

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issue after deployment:

```bash
# 1. Identify last known-good commit
git log --oneline | head -10

# 2. Revert to previous version
git revert <last-good-commit>

# 3. Push to trigger auto-deploy
git push origin main

# 4. Wait for deployment to complete
# Monitor: Render dashboard

# 5. Verify health check
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health

# 6. Announce rollback to team
```

## Monitoring Dashboard

**Uptime Robot:** https://uptimerobot.com/dashboard
**Sentry:** https://sentry.io/projects/
**Render:** https://render.com/dashboard
**Server Logs:** Render → Logs tab

## On-Call Procedures

- Primary on-call: [name] [phone]
- Escalation: Team Lead if primary not responding
- Response time target: 15 minutes
- See WEEK4_ESCALATION.md for full procedures

- Escalate to: Team lead if critical issues
- Escalate to: Backend lead if API issues
- Escalate to: Frontend lead if UI issues

## Escalation Path

```
Level 1: Developer (first responder)
  ↓ (if can't resolve in 15 min)
Level 2: Team Lead
  ↓ (if critical or can't resolve in 30 min)

## What's NOT Complete (Wait for Team Decision)

❌ **Production Deployment** - Not executed yet
- We haven't pushed to production
- We haven't redirected live traffic
- We haven't made permanent production changes
- We haven't crossed the point of no return

This is intentional. Everything is **ready**, but waiting for team decision before deploying.

---

## Next Steps (When Team Is Ready)

1. **Schedule Deployment**
   - Pick date and time
   - Notify team 24 hours before
   - Block calendar for deployment window

2. **Pre-Deployment Day**
   - Day 3 of WEEK4_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md
   - Final verification
   - Create production database backup
   - Team standby for monitoring

3. **Deployment Execution**
   - Follow WEEK4_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md exactly
   - Monitor GitHub Actions workflow
   - Verify health checks
   - Test critical flows

4. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
   - Active monitoring for 4 hours
   - Continuous monitoring for 24 hours
   - Collect user feedback
   - Document any issues

5. **Production Handoff**
   - Operations team takes ownership
   - On-call procedures active
   - Monitoring continues indefinitely
   - Weekly review cycle begins
